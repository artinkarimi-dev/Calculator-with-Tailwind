# 💫 About the Project

This project is a **fully responsive Calculator** built with **HTML, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and Font Awesome**.  
It supports both **Dark & Light Mode**, standard operations, and advanced features such as **percentage (%)**, **power (x²)**, and **square root (√x)**.

The main goal of this project was to learn and implement:

- Deep understanding of **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript
- Practicing **functions**, **booleans**, and conditional logic with `switch / case / break / default`
- Building a **responsive UI** with **TailwindCSS** (instead of raw CSS)
- Implementing a smooth **Dark/Light theme toggle**
- Strengthening problem-solving skills in real coding scenarios

- 📱 Fully **responsive** across all devices using Tailwind utilities  
- ➕➖✖️➗ Standard operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
- 🧮 Advanced features: **%**, **x²**, **√x**, **1/x**  
- ⌨️ Real-time display updates with button clicks  
- 🎯 Clean design with **Font Awesome icons** & custom fonts

## 🧪 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I improved and practiced:

- **DOM manipulation** & event-driven programming  
- Writing modular and reusable **functions**  
- Better understanding of **booleans** in logic handling  
- Using **slice()** to manipulate strings/numbers  
- Applying **switch/case** effectively for calculator logic  
- Making a real-world project **fully responsive** with Tailwind  
- Reading and applying **Tailwind documentation** in practice

## 🧭 How It Works

1. Clicking numbers/operators updates the **display** in real time  
2. Pressing **=** evaluates the entire expression  
3. Extra functions:  
   - **%** → Percentage  
   - **x²** → Square  
   - **√x** → Square root  
   - **1/x** → Inverse  
   - **CE** → Clear entry  
   - **C** → Clear all  
   - **⌫** → Backspace (delete last digit)  
4. Dark/Light mode is toggled by switching Tailwind classes dynamically

## ✅ Final Result

> I’ve made calculators before, but not like this.  
> This was my **first Tailwind project**, and it helped me not only improve my **JavaScript logic** (with advanced functions and clean event handling), but also practice building a **responsive UI** using Tailwind.  
> Features like **Dark/Light Mode** and advanced operations made this project a big step forward in my coding journey.

## 🙌 Special Note

This wasn’t just another calculator — it was a **real learning project**.  
I pushed myself to use **Tailwind practically**, write cleaner **JavaScript**, and build something **professional-looking** that works across all devices 🚀
